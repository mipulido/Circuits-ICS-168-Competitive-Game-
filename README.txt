In Circuits, players compete with each other by moving around a circuit and completing goals given to them.
A player's goal can be either to pass a given point (green gates) or to avoid passing a given point (red gates).
Failing to succeed at your current goal will take off 1 life. Players start with 3 lives; whoever keeps their lives longest wins.
The intention was to make the game online so that each player would be given their own goal.
Since we have the game locally, both players have the same goal.



Player controls:

Enter key -> (Start game)
W / up arrow -> Move forward (let go to stop)
A,D / left, right arrow -> Change lanes
